# MemphisPython.github.io

This is the static html (and css/sass, etc) for [mempy.org](https://www.mempy.org).

## Contributing

Is there something missing from the site? Open a PR to add it, or if you're not
confortable doing that, open an Issue and tell me about it. But *please*, only
edit the `index.html` file. For simplicity sake, we want all the content in a
simple, single-page format.

## A bit of history

This site used to be generated by pelican, but as of June 2019, we've switched
to a single-pabe brochure site (see [PR #1](https://github.com/MemphisPython/MemphisPython.github.io/pull/1).

However, since it's bad form to throw away perfectly-good historical content,
all the old stuff is still in place (at the original URIs).
