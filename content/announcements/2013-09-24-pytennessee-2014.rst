Tennessee will soon have its own regional Python Conference, and it's happening
in Nashville on February 22, 2014!

There will be keynotes, talks, lightning talks, tutorials, open spaces, young
coder sessions and more! As with all regional python conferences, this will
be an event to remember.

The Call for Proposals starts soon (October 1st, 2013), so start planning your
talk, now. PyTennessee aims to have a wide variety of talks including financial,
scientific, systems management, and general development topics.
