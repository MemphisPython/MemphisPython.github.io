As many of you already know, the July python meetup was merged into our
community's annual *Super* user group meeting. It happened on July 17 at
`Cowork Memphis <http://coworkmemphis.com/>`_.

You can find a brief writup with a list of speakers over at the
`Memphis Technology Foundation <http://www.memphistechnology.org/blog/2014/07/11/super-user-group-meetup/>`_ website.

This was an amazing meeting of area technology professionals and enthusiasts,
and if you missed it, you should certainly make it a point to attend next year!
