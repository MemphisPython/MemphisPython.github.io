**Happy New Year!**

It's a new year, and we're kicking it off with something different. This will
be our first *hack night* meeting.

* Bring a laptop and a project, and spend a couple of hours working among friends.
* Don't have a project? Jump in with someone else.
* New to python, and not sure where to start? This will be an excellent time to
  find a mentor!
